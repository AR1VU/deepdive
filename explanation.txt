Saying Hello with Manim

This animation visually demonstrates a simple "Hello, World!" using the Manim animation engine.

The title is introduced, followed by clearly displayed 'Hello, World!' text in the center of the screen. A decorative box frames the greeting text, and the animation closes gracefully.

This example shows how text and shapes can be combined to create clear and welcoming animations.
