The Chain Rule Explained

The chain rule is a fundamental formula in calculus for finding the derivative of a composite function. If you have two functions, f and g, and you create a new function by composing them (i.e., h(x) = f(g(x))), the chain rule gives you a way to differentiate h in terms of f and g.

The chain rule formula states:
If h(x) = f(g(x)), then h'(x) = f'(g(x)) × g'(x).
This means you differentiate the outer function (f) evaluated at the inner function (g(x)), and multiply it by the derivative of the inner function (g).

WHY use the chain rule?

Not all functions are simple—the chain rule is essential when you have nested, or composite, functions, like sin(x^2) or e^{3x+1}.

EXAMPLE:
Let’s differentiate h(x) = (3x + 1)^4.
  Set f(u) = u^4 and g(x) = 3x + 1.
  By the chain rule:
    h'(x) = f'(g(x)) × g'(x) = 4(3x + 1)^3 × 3 = 12(3x + 1)^3

The chain rule is used constantly in calculus, physics, engineering, and many applied sciences.
